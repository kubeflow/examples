    "This solution presents an accessible, non-trivial example of machine learning with financial time series on Google Cloud Platform (GCP).\n",
    "\n",
    "Time series are an essential part of financial analysis. Today, you have more data at your disposal than ever, more sources of data, and more frequent delivery of that data. New sources include new exchanges, social media outlets, and news sources. The frequency of delivery has increased from tens of messages per second 10 years ago, to hundreds of thousands of messages per second today. Naturally, more and different analysis techniques are being brought to bear as a result. Most of the modern analysis techniques aren't different in the sense of being new, and they all have their basis in statistics, but their applicability has closely followed the amount of computing power available. The growth in available computing power is faster than the growth in time series volumes, so it is possible to analyze time series today at scale in ways that weren't previously practical.\n",
    "\n",
    "In particular, machine learning techniques, especially deep learning, hold great promise for time series analysis. As time series become more dense and many time series overlap, machine learning offers a way to separate the signal from the noise, even when the noise can seem overwhelming. Deep learning holds great potential because it is often the best fit for the seemingly random nature of financial time series.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this solution, you will:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Obtain data for a number of financial markets.\n",
    "* Munge that data into a usable format and perform exploratory data analysis in order to explore and validate a premise.\n",
    "* Use TensorFlow to build, train and evaluate a number of models for predicting what will happen in financial markets\n",
    "\n",
    "**Important:** This solution is intended to illustrate the capabilities of GCP and TensorFlow for fast, interactive, iterative data analysis and machine learning. It does not offer any advice on financial markets or trading strategies. The scenario presented in the tutorial is an example. Don't use this code to make investment decisions."

    "The following table shows a number of stock market indices from around the globe, their closing times in Eastern Standard Time (EST), and the delay in hours between the close that index and the close of the S&P 500 in New York. This makes EST the base time zone. For example, Australian markets close for the day 15 hours before US markets close. If the close of the All Ords in Australia is a useful predictor of the close of the S&P 500 for a given day we can use that information to guide our trading activity. Continuing our example of the Australian All Ords, if this index closes up and we think that means the S&P 500 will close up as well then we should either buy stocks that compose the S&P 500 or, more likely, an ETF that tracks the S&P 500. In reality, the situation is more complex because there are commissions and tax to account for. But as a first approximation, we'll assume an index closing up indicates a gain, and vice-versa.\n",

That is, we want to choose one option from a finite set of options, in this case positive or negative. This is the base case of classification where we have only two values to choose from, known as binary classification, or logistic regression.\n",
    "\n",
    "This uses the findings from of our exploratory data analysis, namely that log returns from other regions on a given day are strongly correlated with the log return of the S&P 500, and there are stronger correlations from those regions that are geographically closer with respect to time zones. However, our models also use data outside of those findings. For example, we use data from the past few days in addition to today.  There are two reasons for using this additional data. First, we're adding additional features to our model for the purpose of this solution to see how things perform. which is not a good reason to add features outside of a tutorial setting. Second, machine learning models are very good at finding weak signals from data.\n",

    "From a training and testing perspective, time series data is easy. Training data should come from events that happened before test data events, and be contiguous in time.  Otherwise,  your model would be trained on events from \"the future\", at least as compared to the test data. It would then likely perform badly in practice, because you can’t really have access to data from the future. That means random sampling or cross validation don't apply to time series data. Decide on a training-versus-testing split, and divide your data into training and test datasets.\n",

TensorFlow uses the general definition of classification, that there can be many different potential values to choose from, and a form or encoding for these options called one-hot encoding. One-hot encoding means that each choice is an entry in an array, and the actual value has an entry of 1 with all other values being 0. This encoding (i.e. a single 1 in an array of 0s) is for the input of the model, where you categorically know which value is correct. A variation of this is used for the output, where each entry in the array contains the probability of the answer being that choice. You can then choose the most likely value by choosing the highest probability, together with having a measure of the confidence you can place in that answer relative to other answers.\n",
