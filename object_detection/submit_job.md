# Launch a distributed object detection training job
## Requirements

 - Docker 
 - Docker Registry
 - Object Detection Training Docker Image

Build the TensorFlow object detection training image, or use the pre-built image `lcastell/pets_object_detection` in Docker hub.

## To build the image:
First copy the Dockerfile file from `./docker` directory into your $HOME path
```
# from your $HOME directory
docker build --pull -t $USER/pets_object_detection -f ./Dockerfile .
```

### Push the image to your docker registry
```
# from your $HOME directory
docker tag  $USER/pets_object_detection  <your_server:your_port>/pets_object_detection
docker push <your_server:your_port>/pets_object_detection
```

## Create  training TF-Job deployment and launching it
**NOTE:** You can skip this step and copy the [pets-training.yaml](./jobs/pets-training.yaml) from the `conf` directory and modify it to your needs.
Or simply run:

```
kubectl -n kubeflow apply -f ./jobs/pets-training.yaml
```

### Follow these steps to generate the tf-job manifest file:

Generate the ksonnet component using the tf-job prototype
```
# from the my-kubeflow directory
ks generate tf-job pets-training --name=pets-traning \
--namespace=kubeflow \
--image=<your_server:your_port>/pets_object_detection \
--num_masters=1 \
--num_workers= 1 \
--num_ps= 1
```
Dump the generated component into a K8s deployment manifest file.
```
ks show nocloud -c pets-training > pets-training.yaml
``` 
Add the volume mounts information at the end manifest file. We will be mounting `/pets_data` path to all the containers so they can pull the data for the training job
```
vim pets-training.yaml
```
Add the following to the template.spec:
```
volumes:
  - name: pets-data
    persistentVolumeClaim:
      claimName: pets-data-claim
```
Add the following to the container properties:
```
volumeMounts:
- mountPath: "/pets_data"
  name: pets-data
```
At the end you should have something similar to [this](./jobs/pets-training.yaml)

No you can submit the TF-Job to K8s:
```
kubectl -n kubeflow apply -f pets-training.yaml
```
