# Reinforcement Learning with [tensorflow/agents](https://github.com/tensorflow/agents)

Here we provide a demonstration of training a reinforcement learning agent to perform a robotic grasping task using Kubeflow running on Google Kubernetes Engine. In this demonstration you will learn how to paramaeterize a training job, submit it to run on your cluster, monitor the job including launching a tensorboard instance, and finally producing renders of the agent performing the robotic grasping task.

For clarity and fun you can check out what the product of this tutorial will look like by clicking through the render screenshot below to a short video of a trained agent performing a simulated robotic block grasping task:

### Setup

##### GCP and Kubeflow configuration

This tutorial assumes you have deployed a Kubernetes cluster on your provider of choice and have completed the steps described in the [Kubeflow User Guide](https://github.com/kubeflow/kubeflow/blob/master/user_guide.md) to deploy the core, argo, and nfs components.

##### Launching base image on JupyterHub

This example is intended to be run inside of the `gcr.io/kubeflow/tensorflow-notebook-cpu` container running on JupyterHub which is in turn running on Kubeflow. You may provide the name of this container via the spawner options dialog.

For general troubleshooting of the spawning of notebook containers on JupyterHub or anything else related to your Kubeflow deployment please refer to the [Kubeflow User Guide](https://github.com/kubeflow/kubeflow/blob/master/user_guide.md).

There are two steps to perform from within the JupyterHub environment before the demonstration notebook can be used as intended.

First, we need to obtain the kubeflow example code as follows:

```bash
cd /home/jovyan
git clone https://github.com/kubeflow/examples kubeflow-examples
```

We will also need to authenticate our notebook environment to make calls to the underlying Kubernetes cluster. For example, if this is running on Google Container Engine the command would be as follows:

```bash
gcloud container clusters --project={PROJECT} --zone={ZONE} get-credentials {CLUSTER}
```

Well it looks like our initial setup is finished ðŸŽ‰ðŸŽ‰ and it's time to start playing around with that shiny new demonstration notebook!! You'll find it in doc/demo.ipynb.
