    "\n",
    "In contrast to the [`kfp_remote_deploy.ipynb`](kfp_remote_deploy.ipynb) notebook, this example does not require that the cluster has been set up to use Google Cloud Platform's [Identity-Aware Proxy (IAP)](https://cloud.google.com/iap/). However, it requires that the Kubeflow installation **does not use *basic auth***, as the port-forwarding will not work with a basic auth endpoint.\n",

    "\n",
    "For simplicity of example we do assume a cluster running on [Kubernetes Engine](https://cloud.google.com/kubernetes-engine/) (GKE). However, this basic approach should work for Kubeflow installed on non-GKE  Kubernetes-conformant clusters as well."
