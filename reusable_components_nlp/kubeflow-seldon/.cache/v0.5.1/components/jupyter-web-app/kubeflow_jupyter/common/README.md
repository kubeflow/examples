### BaseUI: Shared functions and Utilities
This module holds functions/configs that both the Default and Rok Jupyter UIs use. Each UI will need to handle its own routes. 

This module is loaded into the `default` and `rok` UIs with the `PYTHONPATH` environment variable. To test the UIs locally, use the corresponding `make` commands.
