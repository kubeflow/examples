# Training TF CNN models

This directory contains code to train convolutional
neural networks using [tf_cnn_benchmarks](https://github.com/tensorflow/benchmarks/tree/master/scripts/tf_cnn_benchmarks)
which is optimized for performance.


For instructions on running these jobs refer to the
[guide](https://www.kubeflow.org/docs/guides/components/tftraining/).

By default the examples run using synthetic data and save the trained model
inside the container.
