_originally opened as https://github.com/graphcool/ui-feedback/issues/71_ ---- hi, we are not using graphcool in the context of a production app but rather a prototype. later we'll have a custom graphql backend but in the meantime we are using graphcool as a mock / readonly graphql endpoint. so i have designed a schema, and i need to create some readonly data manually in graphcool so that i can query it from the demo spa. for my usecase, i found the ux not convenient. - fields are ordered by name while i'd navigate in the fields more easily if the fields where following the declaration order of the schema - during creation, it's quite easy to have a very long list of fields on a type, and having all them on a row is unconvenient. it would be better to display creation form in a popup, with 2 columns fieldname -> fieldvalue , and put the mandatory fields first, the optional afterward, and the non-fillable relationship fields at the end. this popup could also be used view/edit more easily a single row - in case of creation failure, it would be very convenient to not dismiss the form data the user entered. currently on every error we have to start filling the row data from scratch - unability to create relationships during row creation is a problem. this means it's currently impossible to create any row that has a one-to-one mandatory relationship. the workaround is to remove constraints from the schema before adding the data, but it's not very convenient or intuitive."

case sql_varchar:
case sql_wchar:
case sql_wvarchar: ifdef nanodbc_use_unicode col.ctype_ = sql_c_wchar; else col.ctype_ = sql_c_char; endif col.clen_ = col.sqlsize_ + 1 sizeof nanodbc_sqlchar ; i don't know this for sure; i haven't tried it! i might though. if i do i'll let you know. the disadvantage here is that you're committing to one string type in your code at compile time. in theory, your current setup, combined with my pull request, lets you mix and match narrow and wide char strings in the same application, as you choose. _copied from original issue: lexicalunit/nanodbc/pull/18_"

brightpearlsalesorderrowrepository after doing some research about this scenareo, it seems the best practice is to only have a single repository. so for example, you'd only have a brightpearljournalrepository and when you call ->fetchbyid it will return a brightpearl journal entity. this entity will have a property called rows which will be an array of brightpearlsalesorderrow entities. using this technique ensures that we only deal with entities in their complete form, which is the main concept of the entity pattern. it doesn't make sense to retrieve just part of an entity."

from: janne.peltonen@nokia.com when an interface address and subnet is configured through the cli,
the fast path tries to sync the configuration to the os kernel
with an incorrect netmask. for example, ifconfig fp0 10.0.0.1/24 command in cli results in
fast path invoking ifconfig fp0 11.0.0.1 netmask 0.255.255.255 up since the netmask is invalid, my system seems to fall back to
mask lenght of 8 bits so that in kernel the interface gets the
address 11.0.0.1/8. the incorrect subnet in kernel config
gets then synced back to fast path through a netlink notification
so that also the fast path ends up having an incorrect netmask. the bug is caused by ofp_config_interface_up_v4 keeping
netmask in a local variable in the big endian byte order but
failing to convert it back to the native byte order before
calculating the arguments for ifconfig. ofp version: 2.0.0 bugzilla comment id: 212

1. the filteredalignment attempts a conversion even when it shares a data type with the alignment , which should not be necessary.
2. the filteredalignment uses some obscure and obviously wrong method to do the conversion. the first one just makes the setup a bit slower, which should not matter. but the fact that filteredalignment calls datatype.getchar int state is a bug, because there should be a better way to do this translation. beyond that, the existence of datatype.getchar is quite crazy, because it assumes that every int state maps to a single char – and, independent of the codemap input, according to 0→a, 1→b etc. this looks like a very erroneous assumption the effects can be seen in this bug , so i would be very much in favour of deprecating that function and replacing its use, with a sensible implementation of getcode or maybe something else."
