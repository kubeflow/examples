"""https://github.com/flutter/flutter/issues/13803""","flutter engine performance tracing on fuchsia, including vulkan","the flutter engine should add support for performance tracing using the macros in //zircon/system/ulib/trace/include/trace/event.h include <trace/event.h> . it would be useful to see both cpu and gpu time consumed by render tasks. the cpu time is easily measured by using the various trace macros. gpu time is a bit more involved, and it might require changes to skia if so, please file a bug against them, copying the appropriate info from here . the basic idea is to: 1 use vulkan apis to write timestamp events into a query pool 2 when the frame is finished, retrieve those events and add them to the system trace log. the timestamps received from the query pool are not in the same timebase as the trace log, so the times need to be transformed appropriately. an example of how to do this can be found in escher; here's an overview: first, since the vulkan events are in a gpu/driver-dependent timebase; the escher::timestampprofiler class retrieves the query results and transforms them into a vector of timestampprofiler::result, which contain the zx_clock_monotonic time, as well as the number of gpu microseconds used by that part of the frame. next, escher::frame::tracequeryresults adds the events to the trace log. the tricky part is that these events happened in the past, and inserting past events into the trace log isn't directly supported by the convenience macros in <trace/event.h>. tracequeryresults transforms the query times from zx_clock_monotonic to the ticks used by the trace machinery, and then uses the underlying trace apis to add the events at the proper times."

"""https://github.com/tidyverse/dplyr/issues/2936""",permit identification of primary and foreign keys when creating a new sqlite table,"rsqlite has a wonderful feature that permits one to enter data from a flat file e.g., a csv file directly into an sqlite table. dbwritetable does an excellent job of guessing field types and creates the tables with appropriate affinities. however when sqlite tables are created in this way, it is impossible later on to identify primary or foreign fields. unlike other indices, the primary and foreign key fields have to be identified at the time of file definition. it would be a neat addition to the dbwritetable program if there were an option to define the above key fields within the call to dbwritetable. perhaps these definitions could be added by dbwritetable to the table definitions at the step in the program that it detects the column types and defines the column affinities. this would make unnecessary the typical sequence of entering data, reading out the table definition and adding the key constraints, creating a new table, and copying the initial table to the new table. thanks for considering the above. larry hunsicker --- brief description of the problem r insert reprex here"

hardcoded passwords are a dangerous practice for a few reasons. first, having passwords in source code implicitly gives backend system access to anyone with access to the code repository or built binaries. given the history of source code
disclosure flaws in server software, and the possibility of compromise when using cloud-based source code repositories, assuming attacker access to your source code is a prudent philosophy. second, hardcoded passwords make responding to security events more difficult. if a backend password needs to be rotated, a new build must be elevated to compensate. if the value is pulled from a configuration file instead, the operations team can respond nearly instantaneously. recommendation to fix this finding
the password detected should be taken out of source code and made available via configuration management. an encrypted properties file like the one provided by https://code.google.com/p/owasp-esapi-java/source/browse/trunk/src/main/java/org/owasp/esapi/reference/crypto/defaultencryptedproperties.java?r=1121$$link_delim$$esapi would allow the code to be taken out of the source code and be provided environment-specific values. alternatively, the value could be taken from system properties."
