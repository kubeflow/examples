# Training the model

By this point, you should have a Jupyter Notebook running at `http://127.0.0.1:8000`.

Open the Jupyter Notebook interface and create a new Terminal by clicking on New -> Terminal. In the Terminal, clone this git repo by executing: `git clone https://github.com/kubeflow/examples.git`.

Now you should have all the code required to complete this tutorial in the `examples/issue_summarization_github_isses/notebooks` folder. Navigate to this folder. Here you should see two files: `Tutorial.ipynb` and `seq2seq_utils.py`. Open `Tutorial.ipynb` - this contains a complete walk-through of how to go about downloading the training data, preprocessing it and training it.
