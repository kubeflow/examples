# Kubeflow Pipelines examples

Welcome to the samples for Kubeflow Pipelines.
* The [Simple notebook sample](https://github.com/kubeflow/examples/tree/master/pipelines/simple-notebook-pipeline) is designed to teach new users how to create and run Kubeflow Pipelines from a Jupyter notebook on GCP.

* The [MNIST Pipelines sample](https://github.com/kubeflow/examples/tree/master/pipelines/mnist-pipelines)
  runs an MNIST model on a Google Cloud Platform (GCP) and an on premises 
  cluster.

  [kubeflow/pipelines](https://github.com/kubeflow/pipelines/tree/master/samples)
  repository.
