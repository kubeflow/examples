# Kubeflow Pipelines examples

Welcome to the samples for Kubeflow Pipelines.

* The [MNIST Pipelines sample](https://github.com/kubeflow/examples/tree/master/pipelines/mnist-pipelines)
  runs an MNIST model on a Google Cloud Platform (GCP) and an on premises 
  cluster.

* You can find more samples in the 
  [kubeflow/pipelines](https://github.com/kubeflow/pipelines/tree/master/samples)
  repository.
